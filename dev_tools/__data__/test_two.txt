The areas affected by lake-effect snow are called snowbelts.
These include areas east of the Great Lakes, the west coasts of northern Japan,
the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, and areas near the Great Salt Lake, Black Sea,
Caspian Sea, Baltic Sea, and parts of the northern Atlantic Ocean.

* Television encoding: NTSC, PAL and SECAM
* Decoding (computer science)

One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or written,
is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore,
where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message,
typically individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and
reproduce the words sent.

In information theory and computer science, a code is usually considered as an algorithm that uniquely represents symbols
from some source alphabet, by encoded strings, which may be in some other target alphabet.
An extension of the code for representing sequences of symbols over the source alphabet is obtained by
concatenating the encoded strings.
